Antiphuckator
================

A [phpackaton](http://phpers.github.io/phpackaton/) project.

The goal is to build a tool that will allow to use build artifacts (phpcpd, phpunit, phpmdc etc) and comment the code in the very same time and the very same place. To make code reviewing easier and nicer.
