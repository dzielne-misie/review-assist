Review Assist
================

It was supposed to be a [phpackaton](http://phpers.github.io/phpackaton/) project. It's been some time ago however and the project is to be written in [Go](https://golang.org/).

The goal is to build a tool that will allow using build artifacts (copy-paste detector, xunit, mess detector etc.) and commenting the code in a single place. To make code reviewing easier and more pleasant.
